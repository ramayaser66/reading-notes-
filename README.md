## Growth Mindset 
   *A Mindset is a state of mind. Where you are right now, what actions you take, and the choices you make. It is simply how one should always embrace change and be open to new possibilities. growth is achieved by effort and perseverance.*
  
   *For me,to help reach the highest level of growth I always encourage my self with the following:*
   
        -I always remind myself of my goals. 
        -Pursue any opportunity to change for the best.
        -Test my abilities believe I can accomplish more.
   
 ### About my course today (13/12/2020) 
#### Markdown 
*Like HTML it's a markup language but not a programming language ( it doesn't use tags and doesn't do functions ). 
It is light weighted language, easy control and faster to use. 
It requires tools like Visual studio, command terminal and even Notepad.* 

It has a lot of features ( some of which I already applied in this read-note ).
for example:

-Quoting text
using (: or >)
-Italic text
using (* *  or_ )
-Headings
using 
(#text or ## text or ###text)
-Strikethrough 
using (~~ ~~ )
-lists 
using ( - or *) 
 and many others 
 
 #### the installation party 
 
  *for the second part of our course we focused on installing some programs that will be our main concern like the Command line interface (terminal)
  and Visual studio code. we also focused on Setting up WSL Version 2 and the Ubuntu app and it was a very long process 
  these programs require certain tools that had to be installed like Homebrew,gcc,Node & NPM, Git, live-server, Tree and ESLin.this process involved a lot of complicated codes that later was checked and inspected for its latest version and that it its runnung correctly.*
