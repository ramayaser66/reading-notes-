## Growth Mindset 
   *A Mindset is a state of mind. Where you are right now, what actions you take, and the choices you make. It is simply how one should always embrace change and be open to new possibilities. growth is achieved by effort and perseverance.*
  
   *For me,to help reach the highest level of growth I always encourage my self with the following:*
   
        -I always remind myself of my goals. 
        -Pursue any opportunity to change for the best.
        -Test my abilities believe I can accomplish more.
   
 ### About my course today 
#### Markdown 
*Like HTML it's a markup language but not a programming language ( it doesn't use tags and doesn't do functions ). 
It is light weighted language, easy control and faster to use. 
It requires tools like Visual studio, command terminal and even Notepad.* 

It has a lot of features ( some of which I already applied in this read-note ).
for example:

-Quoting text
using (: or >)
-Italic text
using (* *  or_ )
-Headings
using 
(#text or ## text or ###text)
-Strikethrough 
using (~~ ~~ )
-lists 
using ( - or *) 
 and many others
